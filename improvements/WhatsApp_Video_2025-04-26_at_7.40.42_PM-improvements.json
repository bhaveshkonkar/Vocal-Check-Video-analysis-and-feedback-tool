            "how_to_improve": "Vary pitch and volume throughout the script.  Emphasize key phrases like \"change everything,\" \"Season of Skills,\" and \"register right away\" by raising pitch and increasing volume slightly. Practice using different intonations to create a more engaging rhythm and flow."
