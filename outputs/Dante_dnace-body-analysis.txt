The characters in the video are not real people, so they do not display signs like sweating or micro-expressions.

The character on the left, Vergil, maintains a mostly neutral face and an upright posture throughout. His gaze is directed toward Dante, showing a level of attention and engagement. There's no noticeable head movement except when he glances away momentarily. His hands remain near his sword, suggesting readiness for action, although they don't move from that position. There’s no significant leg movement, as he mostly stays still. 

The character on the right, Dante, displays more animated body language. His facial expressions shift from a defiant sneer, particularly when he displays the pizza, to a more open-mouthed, seemingly playful taunt. His eye contact with Vergil is intermittent, sometimes focused, sometimes glancing elsewhere as he moves.  His head bobs rhythmically to the music, indicating his casual, almost mocking, attitude. Dante's posture is relaxed, almost slouching when he stands still, yet energetic when he moves. His hand gestures include pointing, holding the slice of pizza, and other more stylized movements synced with the music. His legs move in a dance-like manner, further emphasizing his lighthearted attitude in contrast to Vergil’s stoicism.
